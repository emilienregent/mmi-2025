- **Game Mechanics**: Discussing simple gameplay mechanics (platformer, puzzle, racing, etc.).
- **Target Audience**: Considering the target audience and the project's complexity.

## Technologies Used
- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **Scripting Language**: C# (using Visual Studio)
- **3D Asset Creation**: Blender

## Roles
- **Manu (Developer)**: Responsible for physics, gameplay, functionalities, and some animations.
- **Louis (3D Artist)**: Focused on 3D asset creation and animations.

## Future Updates
As the project progresses, updates will include the implementation of game features and mechanics, along with asset development.
